pattern recogntion type things

Large and obvious patterns

Is the camera gain detection information reproducable?
	gain settings questions in general
	should be evenly transformed across rgb

future experiments
	flow cam (microscopic pictures)


light intensity

chlorofil concentration


Dr. Hill filters out the solar spectrum


snow from storm AND blown in
	could extrapolate atmospheric data from reanalysis

can get ice concentration from satelite ( course resolution)
can get wind speed
can get atmospheric pressure

NOAA station at Barrow might have similar conditions (lots of atmospheric measurements)

predicting biomass is key
light data with camera would be good for modeling, followed by nutrients
temperature is not a driver of biomass activity

chlorophil (expensive) measured with flourometer.
better to just measure light.

useful to compare all buoys together
	eg. same light different growth
	possible to predict what was different

sometimes buoys can get salinity readings.

Key questions:
	is light switching on earlier in the year? ( delta ice depth, snow thickness ==> more 	light?)

simulate absent data from past years.


light measurement:
	if measuring indiv. wavelengths: photons
	if measuring photosynthetically available information: watts

chlorophil mesaurement:
	mm cph / cubic meter

salinity
	psu

temp
	C


No big difference in equipment between the experiments.


difference in buoys: where they went/drifted to. sensors are consistent


melt pond lets through more light than plain ice; "a window"
	an indication that the ice beneath is going to melt out
	sometimes you wouldnt get enough light for biomass growth til melt ponds gave out

images: bright spots in ice are melt ponds: don't necesarily need to account for them outside of seeing them in the imagery.


Dr. Hill is interested in phytoplankton as a measure of productivity of a system
easy to see from space
easy to measure in the water

you can look at how much light theyre getting
you can observe them as a light sink, blocking light further down the water column.
light is the big thing

different over time?
do we see earlier phytoplankton blooms becasue more light, thinner ice?
do they adapt? or are less flexible?
do subartic species replace them?

change in timing? magnitude? has long reaching effects on the food chain.
case in point: snow crabs in the bearing sea.
